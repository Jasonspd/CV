# Jason Luu

I am a passionate JavaScript and Node.js developer. I loved computers at a young age but only started coding in January 2015. Coding has changed my life, I love learning new stuff, solving challenging problems and building tomorrows software. I believe my greatest attribute is my ability to learn quickly and adapt.
