# Jason Luu

I am a passionate JavaScript and Node.js developer. I loved computers at a young age but only started coding seriously in January 2015. Coding has changed my life, I love learning new stuff and building apps everyday! Learning quickly is my greatest attribute; I like solving problems and finding the best solutions.
